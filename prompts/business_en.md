<!-- PURPOSE: Business argument without inventing numbers (baseline payback ~4 months comes from backend). -->
<!-- OUTPUT: HTML paragraph(s)/list only. -->

<p>The business case focuses on direct time savings in acquisition, offer drafting and delivery. Attention is placed on a handful of high‑leverage automations around {{ hauptleistung }}. Prioritisation follows the “≤ 4‑month payback” rule: start with measures that immediately impact revenue or time; follow up with quality and scaling improvements.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Lever 1:</strong> Standardised offer modules (prompt library) – shortens turnaround and increases the win rate.</li>
  <li><strong>Lever 2:</strong> Knowledge library with semantic search – boosts reuse and reduces response time.</li>
  <li><strong>Lever 3:</strong> Automated intake &amp; qualification – improves lead fit and cuts out blind pitches.</li>
</ul>

<p>Combining these levers delivers visible results within weeks without over‑taxing the resources of a solo practice.</p>
