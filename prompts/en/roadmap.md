# Action plan – Digitalisation & AI in {{ branche }} (focus on {{ hauptleistung }})

Develop a realistic plan for the next twelve months, divided into three phases: **0–3 months**, **3–6 months** and **6–12 months**. Output exactly three HTML `<li>` elements inside a `<ul>`, one for each phase. Each entry starts with the period in bold and then lists 2–3 priority measures separated by semicolons.

When planning, consider:

* strategic goals ({{ projektziel }}) and priority use cases ({{ ki_usecases }})
* company size ({{ unternehmensgroesse }}) and investment budget ({{ investitionsbudget }})
* digitalisation and automation levels, the share of paperless processes and existing AI deployments ({{ ki_einsatz | join(', ') }})
* internal AI know‑how and risk appetite
* additional factors like time capacity, existing tools, regulated industry status, training interests and vision priority—without naming these variables.

Example measures (to be adapted):

- **0–3 months:** Start a data inventory; finalise the questionnaire and test an LLM prototype; launch a mini landing page for lead generation.
- **3–6 months:** Develop an MVP portal and onboard first pilot clients; automate the highest‑priority process (e.g. ticketing); submit funding applications and secure partners.
- **6–12 months:** Scale up a white‑label consulting tool; build governance structures; expand to new markets and grow training offerings.

Use these as inspiration and tailor them to the main service, company size and resources. Avoid generic advice and repetition. If a measure has been listed in quick wins or recommendations, choose a different focus.

The output should consist solely of an HTML unordered list (`<ul>…</ul>`) with three `<li>` elements corresponding to the three time horizons. Do not include tables or JSON blocks.
