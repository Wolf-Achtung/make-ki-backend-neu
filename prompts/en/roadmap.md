Action plan: digitalisation & AI in {{ branche }} (main service {{ hauptleistung }})

Create a concrete action plan for the next 12 months, structured by time horizons:

30 days: immediately implementable steps

3 months: medium‑term measures/milestones

12 months: long‑term roadmap for sustainable success

Note:

Take into account industry‑specific challenges, your company size ({{ unternehmensgroesse }}), the current digitalisation and automation levels ({{ digitalisierungsgrad }}/{{ automatisierungsgrad }}), the proportion of paperless processes ({{ prozesse_papierlos }}), existing AI deployments ({{ ki_einsatz | join(', ') }}) and the internal AI know‑how ({{ ki_knowhow }}).

Refer to the most important tools or funding programmes, but without repeating them – details are in their own chapters!

Provide a clear action suggestion for each measure (keyword + one‑sentence implementation recommendation) and align the measures with your main goal {{ projektziel | join(', ') }} and the prioritised use cases {{ ki_usecases | join(', ') }}.

No generic tips; only individually appropriate steps based on the analysis. Avoid using placeholders like {{ tools_list[0].name }}—instead be specific, for example “Automate processes with a selected AI tool.” Also consider your investment budget ({{ investitionsbudget }}) and your risk tolerance ({{ risikofreude }}).

Tip:
Use bullet points and avoid duplication with other chapters!
