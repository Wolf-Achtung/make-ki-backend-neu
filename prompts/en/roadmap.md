# Action plan: digitalisation & AI in {{ branche }}

Create a concrete action plan for the next 12 months, structured by time horizons:

- 30 days: immediately implementable steps
- 3 months: medium‑term measures/milestones
- 12 months: long‑term roadmap for sustainable success

**Note:**  
- Take into account industry‑specific challenges, team size and resources.
- Refer to the most important tools or funding programmes, but without repeating them – details are in their own chapters!
- Provide a clear action suggestion for each measure (keyword + one‑sentence implementation recommendation).
- No generic tips; only individually appropriate steps based on the analysis (e.g., “Digitise inventory management with {{ tools_list[0].name }}”).

**Tip:**  
Use bullet points and avoid duplication with other chapters!
