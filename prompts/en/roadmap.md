<h3>Short term</h3>
<p>Write one or two short paragraphs about immediately achievable milestones such as policy drafts, data inventories or early automation.

<h3>Medium term</h3>
<p>Describe in one or two paragraphs the plans for the coming months, for example pilot projects, role assignments and documentation. Tell how these steps build on each other and lay the foundation for lasting change. Integrate a brief example that illustrates the progress.</p>
<h3>Long term</h3>
<p>Explain in one or two paragraphs how initiatives can be scaled in the long run (scaling, governance, upskilling) without exact dates. Write in a motivating tone, telling how a project evolves from early successes into a sustained, structured use.</p>
