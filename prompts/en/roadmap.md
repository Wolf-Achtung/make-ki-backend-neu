Craft a **narrative roadmap** with three stages — prose only, **no lists**:

**Immediately:** Put order into data/roles/approvals; a short checklist for human review; traceable filing.
**In the coming weeks:** Two small, well‑bounded automations with entry criteria, pilot and logging.
**Within a year:** Two robust AI use cases with documented roles, deletion plan and a short quality guide.

Write warmly and concretely. **Use time anchors without digits:** “immediately”, “in the coming weeks”, “within a year”.
