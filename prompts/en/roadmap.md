# Action plan: digitalisation & AI in {{ branche }} (focus {{ hauptleistung }})

Develop an action plan for the next 12 months with three time horizons: **0–3 months**, **3–6 months** and **6–12 months**. For each phase list 2–3 priority measures (bullet + one‑sentence recommendation) aligned with your strategic goals ({{ projektziel }}) and priority use cases ({{ ki_usecases }}).

**Note:**
* Consider industry‑specific challenges, company size ({{ unternehmensgroesse }}), digitalisation and automation levels ({{ digitalisierungsgrad }}/{{ automatisierungsgrad }}), the proportion of paperless processes ({{ prozesse_papierlos }}), existing AI deployments ({{ ki_einsatz | join(', ') }}) and internal AI know‑how ({{ ki_knowhow }}), as well as your risk appetite ({{ risikofreude }}).
* Align measures with your investment budget ({{ investitionsbudget }}) and mention relevant tools or funding only briefly – details are provided in their own chapters.
* Avoid generic tips; every step must be individually meaningful and concrete.

**Example for a prioritised timeline:**  
  – **0–3 months:** Finalise the questionnaire and test a GPT prototype; publish a mini‑landing page; start the first feedback loop.  
  – **3–6 months:** Run a pilot project with 1–2 customers or partner companies in {{ branche }}; optimise processes; submit funding applications.  
  – **6–12 months:** Turn the MVP into a scalable white‑label advisory tool; expand into new markets; build partner networks.  
Use these examples as a guide and tailor the specific measures to your main service and company size.

**Tip:** Use bullet points and avoid repetition with other chapters.
