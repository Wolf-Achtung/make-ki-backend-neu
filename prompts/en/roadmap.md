<p>Compose a cohesive roadmap in three paragraphs describing the short‑, medium‑ and long‑term steps of your AI programme. Explain how policy drafts, data inventories, early automations, pilot projects, role assignments, documentation, scaling, governance and upskilling build on each other over time and reinforce each other. Use one paragraph per timeframe but avoid headings, lists or numbers. Tell the story narratively and encouragingly, weaving in brief examples of how teams plan data inventories, run pilot projects and establish structured use in the long run.</p>
