> **Global style guards:** Polite formal *you*, friendly and optimistic. Write **narrative paragraphs** (**no bullet lists**).
> Use **light sub‑headlines** as `<h3 class="sub">…</h3>` to structure. **No percentages.** Prefer **EU‑hosted options** and name **2–3 EU examples**.

Create a **three‑stage roadmap** in prose only. **Time anchors without digits:** “immediately”, “in the coming weeks”, “within a year”.
For each stage cover: purpose → responsible → approval/log → expected everyday effect.
