# Recommendations – Top 5

Generate an HTML ordered list (`<ol>…</ol>`) with the five most important recommendations for the company. Each recommendation should start with a bold action verb and, in one sentence, describe the goal, expected impact and required effort. Conclude each sentence with the impact/effort ratio in brackets (e.g. `(H/M)` for high impact and medium effort).

Combine strategic initiatives (focusing, strengthening the data foundation, establishing governance, piloting & scaling, empowering & networking) with tangible steps derived from vision, strategic goals, biggest potential, moonshot and benchmarks. Avoid repeating items from the quick wins or the action plan.

Tailor the recommendations to company size (solo, small team, SME), time capacity, regulatory requirements, existing tools, training interests and vision priority—without explicitly naming those variables. Solo businesses need cost‑effective, modular measures; larger SMEs can pursue more complex efforts.

Suggested structure (to adapt as needed):

1. **Focus:** Clarify vision and strategy, set priorities and formulate a roadmap that concretises the greatest potential (e.g. GPT‑based services or an AI portal). `(H/M)`
2. **Strengthen data foundation:** Conduct a data inventory, establish central data sources (CRM/ERP) and improve data quality to build a robust basis for AI applications. `(M/M)`
3. **Establish governance:** Implement a lean AI‑governance framework, including data‑protection checks, fairness reviews and compliance processes; for solo companies, a brief “AI policy light” may suffice. `(M/M)`
4. **Pilot & scale:** Prototype a priority use case (e.g. a GPT‑based service MVP), test with selected partners and scale if successful, using quick feedback loops. `(M/M)`
5. **Enable & connect:** Educate your team and stakeholders through training, workshops or external coaching, build networks and partnerships, and address training interests (e.g. automation & scripts). `(L/L)`

Order your actual recommendations by strategic relevance and overall benefit; if tied, choose the lower‑effort action first. The output must be a pure HTML `<ol>` with five `<li>` elements.
