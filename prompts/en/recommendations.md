# Top recommendations

Write an HTML ordered list (`<ol>…</ol>`) containing the top five recommendations for the company. Each recommendation should be a single sentence and include the expected impact (High/Medium/Low) and the required effort (High/Medium/Low) in parentheses at the end, e.g. `(H/M)`. Draw from the vision, strategic goals, greatest potential and moonshot, and consider sector‑specific benchmarks, opportunities and risks. Recommendations should include both strategic actions and concrete next steps and must not duplicate items from the quick wins or the roadmap.

Example:

```
<ol>
  <li><b>Strengthen partnerships:</b> Form strategic alliances with technology providers to expand the AI ecosystem (H/M).</li>
  <li><b>Embed compliance:</b> Enhance data‑protection management and align internal processes with the EU AI Act (M/M).</li>
  …
</ol>
```
