> **Global style guards:** Polite formal *you*, friendly and optimistic. Write **narrative paragraphs** (**no bullet lists**).
> Use **light sub‑headlines** as `<h3 class="sub">…</h3>` to structure. **No percentages.** Prefer **EU‑hosted options** and name **2–3 EU examples**.

Provide **2–3 concrete recommendations** in prose. Tie responsibility, what counts as “done”, and one small precaution (human review, pilot, logging).
Prefer EU options; mention export/roles/logs.
