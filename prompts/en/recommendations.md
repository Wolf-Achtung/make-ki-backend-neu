# Top recommendations

Write an HTML ordered list (`<ol>…</ol>`) containing the five most important recommendations for the company. Each recommendation should be a single sentence beginning with a bold action keyword. Include the expected impact and required effort (High/Medium/Low) in parentheses at the end, for example `(H/M)`. Base your recommendations on the vision, strategic goals, greatest potential and moonshot, and include both strategic initiatives and tangible next steps. For each point, briefly explain the intended outcome or benefit. Do not duplicate items from the quick wins or the action plan.


Consider company size internally only, tailoring recommendations for solo professionals, small teams or SMEs (e.g. scalable subscription models, role clarity or governance) without naming these categories explicitly in the report.

Example:

```
<ol>
  <li><b>Strengthen partnerships:</b> Form alliances with AI technology providers to broaden your offering and accelerate implementation (H/M).</li>
  <li><b>Embed compliance:</b> Improve data‑protection management and align processes with the EU AI Act to reduce legal risks (M/M).</li>
  …
</ol>
```
