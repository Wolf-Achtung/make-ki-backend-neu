**Game‑Changer: “Quiet Guardian”**
A subtle companion (browser/editor add‑on) that inspects inputs for sensitive content
(personal data, secrets) and **warns before sending**. It offers safer alternatives
(e.g., anonymisation) and runs locally or EU‑hosted.

**Side effect & mitigation:** Occasional false alarms are possible — reduce them via a learnable rule‑set
and a **one‑click override** when content is clearly permitted.
