# Funding programmes for digitalisation & AI (status as of {{ datum }})

Present the 3–5 most relevant funding programmes for {{ branche }} in {{ bundesland }} and for the company size {{ unternehmensgroesse }} in a table. Take into account your previous funding experiences ({{ bisherige_foerdermittel }}) and your interest in additional funding ({{ interesse_foerderung }}).

**1. Selection criteria:**  
– Funding amount (sum or percentage), target group, funding focus (AI/digitalisation), deadlines and contact point  
– Programmes should match {{ branche }} and the main goal {{ projektziel }} and support the scaling of the main service {{ hauptleistung }}

**2. Industry context:**  
– Use the industry‑specific funding list:  
  {{ foerderprogramme_list }}  
– Add any up‑to‑date programmes from web‑search results if they are relevant:  
  {{ websearch_links_foerder }}  
– Also consider your region ({{ bundesland }}), company size and previous funding experience and interest.

**3. Presentation:**  
– Output the programmes in an HTML table with the columns **Name**, **Target group**, **Amount** and **Link**.  
– Summarise funding amounts concisely (e.g., “up to 50 %” or “max. €10 000”).  
– List no more than five programmes and avoid duplication.  
– Do not mention tools or measures – those belong in their own chapters.

**Table format (HTML)!**

> **Note:** Output the HTML table directly and do not wrap it in a code block (no ``` fencing). Otherwise the source code will appear instead of the formatted table.
