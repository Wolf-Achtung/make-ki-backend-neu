# Funding programmes for digitalisation & AI (status as of {{ datum }})

Present the 3–5 most relevant funding programmes (current, for {{ branche }}, {{ bundesland }}, {{ unternehmensgroesse }}) in a table. Take into account your previous funding experiences ({{ bisherige_foerdermittel }}) and your interest in further funding ({{ interesse_foerderung }}).

**1. Criteria:**  
- Current funding amount, target group, funding focus (AI/digitalisation), deadlines, source link

**2. Industry context:**  
- Use the industry‑specific funding list:  
  {{ foerderprogramme_list }}
- If available, add new programmes or news from the web search results:  
  {{ websearch_links_foerder }}
 - Also consider your answers on existing funding and current funding interests.

**3. Presentation:**
- Use concise column names to keep the table compact: for each programme list the **name**, **link**, **target group**, **funding** and **deadline**. Avoid long labels like “Funding rate” that may wrap across lines.
- Do not mention tools or measures – they are covered in their own chapters.

**Table format (HTML)!**

> **Note:** Output the HTML table directly and **do not wrap it in a code block** (no ``` fencing). Otherwise the source code will appear instead of the formatted table.
