# Funding programmes for digitalisation & AI (status as of {{ datum }})

List the 3–5 most relevant funding programmes currently available for {{ branche }} in {{ bundesland }} and for company size {{ unternehmensgroesse }}. Take into account previous funding experiences ({{ bisherige_foerdermittel }}) and your stated interest in additional funding ({{ interesse_foerderung }}).

**1. Criteria:**  
- Funding amount (percentage or maximum sum), target group, region, funding purpose and deadline.  
- Ensure each programme is applicable to the industry and company size.

**2. Industry context:**  
- Use the industry‑specific funding list:  
  {{ foerderprogramme_list }}
- If available, add programmes or updates from web search results:  
  {{ websearch_links_foerder }}
- Consider your answers about existing funding and current funding interests.

**3. Presentation:**  
- Use an HTML table with seven columns: **Name**, **Target group**, **Region**, **Amount**, **Purpose**, **Deadline**, and **Link**.  
- Summarise the funding amount concisely (e.g., “up to 50 %”, “max. €10 000”). Show 3–5 programmes that fit your industry, region and company size, avoiding duplicates.  
- Do not mention tools or measures here – they are covered in other chapters.

**Note:** Output the HTML table directly and **do not wrap it in a code block** (no ``` fencing). Otherwise the source code will appear instead of the formatted table.
