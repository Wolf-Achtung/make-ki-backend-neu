Contextualise funding **qualitatively** for {{ bundesland }} (or federal level if unknown).
In paragraphs, cover:
– What is currently well supported (e.g., **data groundwork**, **small pilots**, **skills**).
– How a **funding‑ready mini‑path** looks (goal, small steps, observable effect, **no percentages**).
Point to **EU hosting**, exportability and documentation. Mention regional specifics where plausible (e.g., Berlin bonus).
