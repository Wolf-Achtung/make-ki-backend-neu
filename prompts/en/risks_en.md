Produce a **risk matrix** (5 rows) as an HTML `<table class="compact risk">` with `<thead>`/`<tbody>` and these exact columns:
- Risk
- Area
- Likelihood (1–5)
- Impact (1–5)
- Mitigation (concrete action)
- Owner (role/function)
- Due (e.g., 30/90 days)

**Rules**
- Only numbers 1–5 for Likelihood/Impact; no percentages.
- Short, specific phrasing; no fluff.
- Typical risks: prompt leakage, hallucinations, vendor lock‑in, PII/GDPR, quality defects.
