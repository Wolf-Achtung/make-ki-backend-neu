Key risks – potential challenges
Create an HTML unordered list (<ul>…</ul>) containing no more than three key risks associated with the company’s adoption of artificial intelligence. Each bullet should begin with a bold keyword (<b>…</b>) and consist of a single sentence describing the risk and, where appropriate, a brief suggestion for mitigating it. Use the questionnaire responses on compliance, obstacles, risk appetite and data protection, as well as external factors such as uncertain regulation, limited budget, time constraints and data quality. Important: The KPI categories (digitalisation, automation, paperless processes and AI know‑how) are not risks and must not be listed here. Keep the language succinct and clear, avoiding repetition.
Example:
<ul>
  <li><b>Data protection:</b> Vague consent management can lead to GDPR violations; run a data‑protection audit and establish clear procedures.</li>
  <li><b>Bias & transparency:</b> Without regular model audits, there is a risk of discriminatory outcomes; schedule fairness checks and document processes.</li>
  <li><b>Vendor lock‑in:</b> Over‑reliance on a single AI provider can be risky; evaluate alternative vendors and consider open‑source options.</li>
</ul>
