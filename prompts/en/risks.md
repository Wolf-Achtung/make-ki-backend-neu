# Key risks – potential challenges

Create an HTML unordered list (`<ul>…</ul>`) containing **no more than three key risks** associated with the company’s adoption of artificial intelligence. Each bullet should begin with a bold keyword (`<b>…</b>`) and consist of a single sentence describing the risk and, where appropriate, a brief suggestion for mitigating it. Use the questionnaire responses on compliance, obstacles, risk appetite and data protection, as well as external factors such as uncertain regulation, limited budget, time constraints and data quality. **Important:** The KPI categories (digitalisation, automation, paperless processes and AI know‑how) are not risks and must not be listed here. Keep the language succinct and clear, avoiding repetition.

You may also take into account context factors such as time capacity (`time_capacity`), existing tools (`existing_tools`), regulated industry flags (`regulated_industry`), training interests (`training_interests`) and the vision priority (`vision_priority`) to identify resource constraints, compliance requirements, learning needs or strategic focuses – but do not mention these variable names in the report.

Focus on the main hurdles identified in the questionnaire – in particular **legal uncertainty**, **limited budget**, **lack of time** and **poor data quality** – and select up to three of these as the key risks. Summarise each risk in a single sentence and, where appropriate, suggest a brief mitigation.

Example:

```
<ul>
  <li><b>Regulatory & data protection:</b> Unclear compliance obligations and privacy duties pose legal risks; a legal check brings clarity.</li>
  <li><b>Data quality & traceability:</b> Unstructured or incomplete data hampers meaningful analysis and undermines transparency; set clear data standards and a central repository.</li>
  <li><b>Resource & budget constraints:</b> Limited funds or capacity slow down projects and reduce the likelihood of success; plan smaller, prioritised steps and secure funding.</li>
</ul>
```
