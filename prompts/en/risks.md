# Key risks – potential challenges

Create an HTML unordered list (`<ul>…</ul>`) with three to five key risks related to the company’s adoption of artificial intelligence. Each bullet should begin with a bold keyword (`<b>…</b>`) followed by one sentence describing the risk and, where possible, a concise mitigation suggestion. Use the questionnaire responses on compliance, obstacles, risk appetite and data protection, as well as typical industry‑specific hazards such as GDPR violations, bias and transparency issues, vendor lock‑in and data security. Avoid generic statements and ensure that each risk is relevant to the company’s context.

Example:

```
<ul>
  <li><b>Data protection:</b> Unclear legal basis and missing consent workflows can lead to GDPR violations; introduce a data‑protection audit and clear consent management.</li>
  <li><b>Bias & transparency:</b> Insufficient model audits risk discriminatory outcomes; schedule regular fairness assessments and document processes.</li>
  …
</ul>
```
