Explain key risks calmly: data sources, quality, hallucinations, rights & duties (GDPR, ePrivacy, DSA, EU AI Act), 
change aspects and vendor dependencies. 
For each, show **how** to reduce it pragmatically (guardrails, human validation, internal guidance, training) â€“ 
reassuring, never alarmist.
