Purpose: Risks & mitigations as narrative paragraphs. Topics: data spill, hallucinations, vendor lock‑in, shadow IT, over‑automation.
Form: 2–3 <h3 class='sub'> subheads, one compact paragraph per topic: “Why relevant here” → “What to do (data minimisation, approvals, logs, export, rollback)”.
Tone: calm, constructive.
