# Key risks – potential challenges

Create an HTML unordered list (`<ul>…</ul>`) with three to five key risks related to the company’s adoption of artificial intelligence. Each bullet should be a single sentence describing the risk and, where appropriate, offering a brief mitigation hint. Use the questionnaire responses on compliance, obstacles, risk appetite and data protection, as well as typical industry‑specific hazards (e.g. GDPR, transparency/bias, vendor lock‑in). Bold the first keyword of each item (`<b>…</b>`).

Example:

```
<ul>
  <li><b>Data protection:</b> Unclear legal basis and missing consent workflows can lead to GDPR violations.</li>
  <li><b>Bias & transparency:</b> Insufficient model audits risk discriminatory outcomes; regular assessments are needed.</li>
  …
</ul>
```
