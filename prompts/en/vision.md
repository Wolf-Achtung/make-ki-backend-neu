# Visionary recommendation (gamechanger)

**Context:**
- Industry: {{ branche }}
- Main product/service: {{ hauptleistung }}
- Company size: {{ unternehmensgroesse }}
- Company type: {{ unternehmensform }}
- State/region: {{ bundesland }}

**Task:**
Define a visionary recommendation (gamechanger) that is ambitious yet realistic for the company’s industry, service, size, type and location. The idea should convey a clear competitive advantage and be measurable.

**Format:**  
– Return **valid HTML only** (no `<html>` wrapper).  
– Use a three‑part structure:  
  1. **Bold idea**: Provide a heading (`<h3>`) and one‑sentence paragraph explaining the concept in clear, descriptive language (e.g., “Automated advisory portal for self‑service diagnostics”).  
  2. **MVP**: A heading and short paragraph describing a minimal viable prototype that can be built in 2–4 weeks, including an estimated cost (for example, “from €5 000”) and outlining the main components.  
  3. **KPIs**: A `<ul>` listing three measurable success indicators (e.g., client retention, time savings, revenue growth) relevant to {{ hauptleistung }}. Use ranges (e.g., “+15–20 %”) rather than single numbers where appropriate.

**Content guidelines:**  
– Focus on concrete, forward‑looking actions such as new digital services, automation projects, data‑driven business models or AI‑powered platforms.  
– Ensure the recommendation is specific, measurable and aligned with {{ hauptleistung }} and {{ unternehmensgroesse }}.  
– Include an example or analogy only if it clarifies the concept; avoid superlatives or vague phrasing.

Keep the total length under eight sentences.
