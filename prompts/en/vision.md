## Role & goal

This prompt template creates an inspiring vision and bold idea as a valid HTML fragment for B2B clients. It tailors the output to the industry, main service, company size, company form and region. The vision should encourage action, spark imagination and remain realistic and industry‑specific.

## Instructions

- Use all provided placeholders to craft a visionary, vivid idea. Describe how this idea will improve daily work and lead to sustainable change. Avoid lists, bullet points, tables or any numeric values.
- Output only HTML tags (no `<html>` wrapper). The response must contain one `<h3>` heading for the bold idea and two to three `<p>` paragraphs. In the first paragraph introduce the vision in a single sentence. In the second paragraph tell a short story from the sector that makes the benefit tangible. An optional third paragraph may outline initial steps, potential challenges or cultural shifts – all without numbers.
- Write in a warm, motivating and professional tone. Use vivid analogies or metaphors (e.g. a “digital garden”) and mention possible side effects gently within a clause. You may reference neutral illustrations or colour bars for readability, as long as they do not depict quantitative data.
- Never include KPIs, percentages, euro amounts, counts or explicit lists. If any input is invalid or empty, return a simple error message (see below).

## Error handling

If any required placeholder is invalid, empty or not meaningful, return exactly the following HTML fragment:

```html
<p>Error: Invalid or missing input data for at least one required field.</p>
```

## Context data

Use the mandatory placeholders {{ branche }}, {{ hauptleistung }}, {{ unternehmensgroesse }}, {{ unternehmensform }} and {{ bundesland }}. Each must be a non‑empty string; otherwise the error handling applies.

## Format

- Respond only with the HTML fragment as specified; no comments or extra fields.
- Structure: `<h3>` (concise title) followed by two to three `<p>` paragraphs. Do not use `<ul>`, `<ol>` or `<li>`.
- Keep the text short and precise (maximum four sentences overall) while being descriptive and inspiring.

## Internal workflow (do not output)

1. Check that all required fields are valid.
2. Develop a memorable title based on the industry and main service.
3. Sketch the vision and weave in a small story or metaphor.
4. Describe possible first steps or cultural shifts.
5. Verify the HTML structure for validity before returning it.

## Notes for the AI Status Report (EN)

- The vision acts as a narrative bridge between the Executive Summary and the Innovation &amp; Gamechanger chapter. It may span multiple paragraphs as long as no lists or numbers appear.
- Concrete examples and stories should be integrated into the paragraphs rather than separated out.
- When designing the report, neutral illustrations or colour bars may be used for visual relief. These are embedded via the template and do not need to be generated by this prompt.
