## Role & goal

This prompt template generates a tailored visionary recommendation (gamechanger idea) as a valid HTML fragment for B2B clients, customised to the industry, main service, company size, company form and region ({{ bundesland }}).

## Workflow

You may internally (not in the output) create a brief checklist of sub‑tasks: (1) verify input validity, (2) generate the bold idea and vision statement, (3) formulate an MVP with cost estimate, (4) provide three sector‑specific KPIs, and (5) check structure and format for correctness.

## Instructions
- Use all provided placeholders to craft a forward‑looking, concrete and measurable recommendation.
- The response MUST be a valid HTML fragment (no `<html>` wrapper) in exactly the following order:
    1. An `<h3>` heading for the bold idea (a succinct title) followed by a `<p>` with a one‑sentence vision statement.
    2. An `<h3>` heading for the MVP with the title “MVP (2–4 weeks, from {amount} €)” followed by a `<p>` with a short MVP description (max. 2 sentences, including costs formatted as “from {integer} €”).
    3. A `<ul>` with exactly 3 `<li>` KPIs (indicator + rounded percentage value in the format “+30 %” or “–20 %”).

## Output details
- Avoid fluff or generalities. No more than 8 sentences in total.
- Focus on transformative measures, specific and sector‑relevant ideas (e.g. digital services, automation, AI, data‑driven models); ensure they are measurable and aligned with the main service and company size.
- Optionally include one concrete example or comparison for clarity (max. 1 sentence).
- Cost format must always be a whole number from 1 000 € upwards, with a narrow space in four‑digit numbers (e.g. “from 5 000 €”).
- KPIs must be relevant and sector‑specific; percentage values rounded; maximum 3 indicators.
- All placeholders ({{ ... }}) are mandatory and may not be empty, generic or invalid (e.g. “unknown”, “–”).

## Error handling
- If any mandatory placeholder contains an invalid, empty or uninformative value, return exactly the following HTML fragment:
<p>Error: Invalid or missing input data for at least one required field.</p>

## Context data
- Mandatory placeholders: {{ branche }}, {{ hauptleistung }}, {{ unternehmensgroesse }}, {{ unternehmensform }}, {{ bundesland }} — each as a descriptive, non‑empty string.

## Reasoning and checking (internal)
- Internally verify step by step whether all required fields are valid. Maintain structure and format exactly. Test the final HTML output for strict validity. After each relevant step, check whether the partial result is valid and properly formatted before proceeding.

## Format
- Output is solely the HTML fragment as specified; no comments or other output.
- On error always return the specified error message within a `<p>`.

## Scope
- Always concise and precise, never verbose or vague.

## Agent behaviour and stop criteria
- Generate the suggestion autonomously according to these instructions and stop after producing a complete, correctly formatted HTML fragment.
