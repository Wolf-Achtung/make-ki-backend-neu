# Visionary recommendation (gamechanger)

**Context:**
- Industry: {{ branche }}
- Main product/service: {{ hauptleistung }}
- Company size: {{ unternehmensgroesse }}
- Company type: {{ unternehmensform }}
- State/region: {{ bundesland }}

**Task:**
Formulate a **visionary recommendation (gamechanger idea)** tailored to the industry, main product, company size, company type and location. The recommendation should be ambitious yet realistic and deliver a clear competitive advantage.

**Format:**  
– Return **valid HTML only** (no `<html>` wrapper).  
– Use a clear three‑part structure:  
  1. **Bold idea** (title in `<h3>` + one‑sentence `<p>`): Describe the transformative vision (e.g. “automated online consulting”).  
  2. **MVP** (another `<h3>` + short paragraph): Explain a minimal viable prototype that can be implemented in 2–4 weeks, including approximate cost (e.g. “from €5 000”).  
  3. **KPIs**: List three measurable success metrics in a `<ul>`; typical KPIs include **customer retention**, **time savings** and **market share** (or similar metrics suited to {{ hauptleistung }}).  
– Use no more than eight sentences in total; avoid filler phrases.

**Content guidelines:**  
– Focus on forward‑looking, transformative actions (e.g. new digital services, automation, data‑driven business models, AI‑powered platforms).  
– The recommendation must be **specific, measurable and industry‑relevant**, and should align with the main service {{ hauptleistung }} and company size {{ unternehmensgroesse }}.  
– If appropriate, include a short example or comparison to clarify your idea.

**Example structure:**
```html
<h3>Bold idea: Automated online consulting</h3>
<p>A fully digital consulting platform using GPT‑powered questionnaires provides real‑time advice to clients.</p>
<h3>MVP (2–4 weeks, from €5 000)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Customer retention: +30%</li>
  <li>Time savings per project: −40%</li>
