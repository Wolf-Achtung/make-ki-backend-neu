Compliance status & recommendations for {{ branche }} (main service {{ hauptleistung }})

Analyse the company’s compliance status based on the form data, company size ({{ unternehmensgroesse }}), legal form ({{ unternehmensform }}) and main service {{ hauptleistung }}. The focus is on data protection and AI regulation.

1. Legal requirements & guidelines:

• Identify relevant laws such as GDPR, ePrivacy, the Digital Services Act, competition law and consumer protection, as well as industry‑specific standards: {{ branchenspezifische_standards }}.  
• Consider whether a data protection officer is in place ({{ datenschutzbeauftragter }}) and which technical measures have already been implemented ({{ technische_massnahmen }}).

2. Consent management & customer rights:

• Describe how consent is obtained and documented (consent management), whether privacy by design/default is implemented and any particular issues arising from the service {{ hauptleistung }} ({{ consent_besonderheiten }}).  
• Include existing reporting channels and erasure rules ({{ meldewege }}, {{ loeschregeln }}) and assess the internal AI know‑how ({{ ki_knowhow }}).

3. AI‑specific compliance:

• Assess documentation obligations, transparency, fairness and bias analyses for AI‑supported consulting ({{ hauptleistung }}), particularly when using GPT‑based models.  
• Take into account EU AI Act compliance and required risk analyses.

4. Immediate actions & strategic steps:

• Provide 3–4 prioritised measures for the short and medium term (e.g., data‑protection audit, template contracts for data processing, introduction of a data protection management system, training).  
• Consider company size: for solo self‑employed advisors suggest lean processes and, if necessary, outsourcing (e.g., appointing an external data protection officer).

5. Weaknesses & solutions:

• Name 2–3 specific weaknesses (e.g., lack of erasure policies, unclear data flows, insufficient documentation).  
• For each weakness provide a proposed solution or an initial step.

*Do not include generic checklists and do not mention tools, funding programmes or roadmap actions – those have their own chapters.*
