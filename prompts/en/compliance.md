# Compliance status & recommendations

Analyse the company’s compliance situation based on questionnaire data (e.g. data protection officer, technical safeguards, data‑protection impact assessments, reporting routes, deletion rules and knowledge of the EU AI Act). You may use an internal checklist to structure your work but do not output it.

## 1. Legal requirements & guidelines
- List the applicable legal frameworks (e.g. GDPR, ePrivacy, Digital Services Act, competition and consumer law, and any industry‑specific standards).
- Briefly note how existing company structures (e.g. data protection officer, technical measures) meet these requirements or where gaps exist.

## 2. Consent management & customer rights
- Describe consent management, CRM processes and implementation of privacy by design/default in bullet points.
- Include any reporting paths, deletion rules and internal AI expertise.

## 3. AI‑specific compliance
- List special obligations when using AI: documentation, transparency, fairness and bias analyses, impact assessments, and compliance with the EU AI Act (if relevant).

## 4. Immediate actions & strategic steps
- Provide 3–4 priority actions (e.g. data‑protection check, drafting a data‑processing agreement, establishing an AI governance framework, staff training, supplier audits, introducing a data‑protection management system).
- Adapt these actions to company size and main service, drawing on the questionnaire data.

## 5. Weaknesses & solutions
- Identify 2–3 current weaknesses (e.g. unclear data flows, missing deletion concepts, insufficient documentation).
- For each weakness, suggest a concrete first step towards remediation.

**Example Table:**

| Weakness                 | Solution proposal                                |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Missing deletion rules  | Develop and implement a clear deletion concept   |
| Inadequate documentation| Create up‑to‑date process documentation          |

**Notes:**
- Use only the information provided in the questionnaire.
- Do not output placeholders or abbreviations like “n/a”; omit points with no data.
- Avoid generic checklists.
- Do not include tools, funding programmes or action‑plan measures here; they belong in other sections.

**Formatting:**
- Deliver your response as a structured Markdown document with five numbered main sections (## 1.–## 5.).
- Use short bullet lists in each section.
- In section 5, you may use a table or a list to present weaknesses and solutions.
- Omit sections or bullets if no data is available.
