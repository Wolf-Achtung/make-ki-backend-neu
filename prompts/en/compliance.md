# Compliance status & recommendations for {{ branche }} (main service {{ hauptleistung }})

Analyse the compliance situation (standards, guidelines, to‑dos) for the company based on your form data (e.g., availability of a data protection officer, technical security measures, DPIA/DSFA, reporting paths, erasure rules, knowledge of the EU AI Act, etc.).

**1. Legal requirements & guidelines:**  
- List the relevant legal frameworks, such as GDPR, ePrivacy, the Digital Services Act, competition and consumer protection law, and industry‑specific standards: {{ branchenspezifische_standards }}.  
  Comment briefly on how your existing setup (e.g., data protection officer: {{ datenschutzbeauftragter }}, technical measures: {{ technische_massnahmen }}) addresses these requirements or where gaps may exist.

**2. Consent management & customer rights:**  
- Describe your consent management, CRM processes and implementation of privacy by design/default, including any special aspects: {{ consent_besonderheiten }}.  
  Take into account existing processes (reporting channels: {{ meldewege }}, erasure rules: {{ loeschregeln }}) and your internal AI know‑how ({{ ki_knowhow }}).

**3. AI‑specific compliance:**  
- Address the particular obligations associated with the use of AI: documentation requirements, transparency duties, fairness and bias analyses, impact assessments and, where applicable, compliance with the EU AI Act.

**4. Immediate actions & strategic steps:**  
- Provide 3–4 prioritised measures for the short to medium term. Examples include: data‑protection audit, establishing a data‑processing agreement, introducing an AI governance framework, focused staff training, supplier audits or rolling out a data‑protection management system (DPMS).  
  Tailor the steps to the company size and main product and use the information in {{ compliance_schritte }} for inspiration.

**5. Weaknesses & solutions:**  
- Name 2–3 current weaknesses (e.g., unclear data flows, missing deletion concepts, insufficient documentation).  
  For each weakness, formulate a concrete proposal or first step to remedy it.

**Note:**  
Avoid generic checklists. Do not mention any tools, funding programmes or roadmap measures – these appear in their own chapters.
