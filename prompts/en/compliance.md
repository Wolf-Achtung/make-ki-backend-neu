# Compliance status & recommendations for {{ branche }} (main service {{ hauptleistung }})

Provide a structured analysis of the company’s compliance status with relevant regulations and guidelines and suggest concrete improvements.

1. **Legal requirements & guidelines:** Summarise the applicable legal frameworks (e.g., GDPR, ePrivacy, Digital Services Act, competition and consumer protection law, and industry‑specific standards {{ branchenspezifische_standards }}). Explain briefly how your current setup (data protection officer: {{ datenschutzbeauftragter }}, technical measures: {{ technische_massnahmen }}) meets these requirements and highlight any gaps.

2. **Consent management & customer rights:** Describe the existing consent management and privacy processes, including CRM workflows and privacy‑by‑design/default practices. Incorporate any special aspects ({{ consent_besonderheiten }}) and note any issues with reporting paths ({{ meldewege }}) or erasure rules ({{ loeschregeln }}). Link these observations to your internal AI know‑how ({{ ki_knowhow }}).

3. **AI‑specific compliance:** Describe obligations associated with AI use, such as documentation and transparency requirements, fairness and bias analyses, impact assessments and (where relevant) compliance with the EU AI Act.

4. **Immediate actions & strategic steps:** Suggest three to four prioritised measures tailored to the company’s size and main service. Examples include commissioning a data‑protection audit, establishing a data‑processing agreement, setting up an AI governance framework, targeted training for staff, auditing suppliers or implementing a data‑protection management system (DPMS). Use {{ compliance_schritte }} for inspiration.

5. **Weaknesses & solutions:** Identify two to three current weaknesses (e.g., unclear data flows, missing deletion concepts, insufficient documentation) and suggest a concrete first step to address each. Focus on actionable improvements rather than restating problems.
