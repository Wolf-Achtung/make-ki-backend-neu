# Compliance status & recommendations

## Style note – Clear narrative tone

When writing this section, adopt a warm, approachable tone that demystifies the legal landscape for small and midsized businesses. Avoid jargon and acronyms unless they are explained. Imagine you are advising a thoughtful founder who wants to use AI responsibly: explain why each regulation matters and how it can be turned from a burden into an advantage. Use complete sentences to weave information together rather than terse bullet points. Draw inspiration from the following:

> Many people still associate “Artificial Intelligence” with complex technology and giant corporations. Yet for small businesses, freelancers and self‑employed professionals there is a huge opportunity: AI isn’t just for the “big players.” It can lighten your daily workload, make processes clearer and open new ways of engaging with customers. With decades of experience in the media sector, I know that real progress comes from practical solutions that fit everyday life. AI can take over repetitive tasks, help you assess information more quickly and open new channels for outreach. Often it’s about starting with small steps where relief is tangible. Crucially, AI is a tool, not a goal in itself; used wisely it gives you more freedom for strategic decisions, creativity or simply a calmer day. You decide which role AI plays and how quickly you adopt it. Think of AI as a partner that adapts to your reality – and seize opportunities that strengthen your business and make your work easier.

Throughout this chapter, summarise the legal frameworks and concrete actions in narrative paragraphs. If you need to list items (e.g. weaknesses and solutions), introduce them with a sentence and then present them in a clean list or table. Use the most recent guidance (as of early 2025) from the EU AI Act and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The AI Act takes a risk‑based approach: it bans unacceptable uses of AI (e.g. social scoring or subliminal manipulation)【2690173314419†L78-L170】, sets strict obligations for “high‑risk” systems (e.g. risk assessments, data quality, transparent documentation, logging, human oversight and robustness【2690173314419†L78-L170】) and imposes a duty on employers to ensure employees working with or developing AI have adequate training in AI ethics and compliance【67385344376772†L1748-L1805】. The GDPR, meanwhile, requires transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation and lawful bases for processing, gives individuals rights over their data and obliges controllers to conduct data‑protection impact assessments (DPIAs) when deploying high‑risk processing. When recommending actions, emphasise proportionate measures that fit small business contexts and align with these regulations.

Analyse the company’s compliance situation based on questionnaire data (e.g. data protection officer, technical safeguards, data‑protection impact assessments, reporting routes, deletion rules and knowledge of the EU AI Act). You may use an internal checklist to structure your work but do not output it.

## 1. Legal requirements & guidelines

Describe, in one or two paragraphs, the legal frameworks that apply to the respondent’s business. Explain how the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive/Regulation and sector‑specific rules (e.g. competition and consumer law or health‑care regulations) set the boundaries for processing personal and business data. Highlight relevant provisions of the EU AI Act: the prohibition of unacceptable practices and the obligations for high‑risk systems (risk assessment, data quality, traceability, transparency and human oversight). Note how existing company structures – such as a data protection officer, technical safeguards or documented procedures – align with these rules, and point out any gaps.

## 2. Consent management & customer rights

Explain how the company manages consent and honours customer rights. Describe the processes for collecting and documenting consent (opt‑in), the role of customer relationship management (CRM) systems and how privacy by design/default is implemented in products and services. Mention any channels through which individuals can request access or deletion of their data. If the company handles AI models or data sets internally, indicate whether data minimisation and deletion rules are in place. Finally, comment on the level of internal AI expertise regarding privacy (e.g. presence of a DPO or staff training).

## 3. AI‑specific compliance

Discuss the obligations that arise specifically when employing AI systems. In a concise paragraph or two, explain that high‑risk AI systems require rigorous documentation, transparency about purpose and functioning, risk and bias assessments, and robust record‑keeping for traceability【2690173314419†L78-L170】. Mention the AI Act’s requirement to carry out conformity assessments and register certain systems. Note that employers have a duty to ensure that staff developing or using AI have adequate AI and data‑protection training【67385344376772†L1748-L1805】, and suggest that the company consider such training programmes. If relevant, advise on how to prepare a data‑protection impact assessment (DPIA) and how to implement mechanisms for human oversight and explainability.

## 4. Immediate actions & strategic steps

Recommend three to four priority measures tailored to the company’s size and sector. Write each action as a full sentence, focusing on both immediate compliance steps (e.g. conducting a data‑protection check or drafting data‑processing agreements) and longer‑term strategic steps (e.g. establishing an AI governance framework, conducting supplier audits or introducing a privacy management system). Encourage small steps that fit the organisation’s resources – for instance, starting with an inventory of AI tools and models, clarifying roles and responsibilities for AI and data processing, and developing staff training programmes to build AI competence and GDPR awareness. Make the narrative practical and encouraging.

## 5. Weaknesses & solutions

Identify two or three concrete weaknesses in the current compliance posture – such as unclear data flows, missing deletion concepts or insufficient documentation. Present each weakness with a brief narrative explanation and a practical solution. For example, “Currently there is no clear concept for deleting obsolete data. A first step is to map data flows and define retention periods in cooperation with a data protection expert.” Use a table or a simple list to present the weaknesses and solutions clearly. Focus on meaningful, achievable steps that move the company forward.

**Example Table:**

| Weakness                 | Solution proposal                                |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Missing deletion rules  | Develop and implement a clear deletion concept   |
| Inadequate documentation| Create up‑to‑date process documentation          |

**Notes:**
- Use only the information provided in the questionnaire.
- Do not output placeholders or abbreviations like “n/a”; omit points with no data.
- Avoid generic checklists.
- Do not include tools, funding programmes or action‑plan measures here; they belong in other sections.

**Formatting:**

Deliver your response as an HTML fragment consisting of five numbered main sections (## 1–5) with descriptive paragraphs. You may use simple lists or a table only where appropriate (e.g. weaknesses and solutions). Avoid bullet lists for the main content; instead, write full sentences that guide the reader through the compliance landscape. Leave out a section entirely if no relevant data is provided.

## Additional Instructions for the AI Status Report (EN)

Append these guidelines to the end of your existing prompt templates to elevate the AI Status Report to gold standard. They ensure concise lists, detailed actions and a clear, actionable roadmap.

### Trim and aggregate lists

* **Quick Wins (3 items)** – List no more than three immediately actionable wins. If there are more ideas, combine them into a single summary item titled “Additional Quick Wins.”
* **Risks (3 items)** – Mention at most three risks. Extra risks should be grouped under “Additional Risks,” summarised briefly.
* **Recommendations (5 items)** – Provide up to five recommendations. Any further suggestions are combined under “Additional Recommendations.”

### Structure of the Quick Wins

Each quick win should include the following fields:

1. **Title** – a concise name for the action.
2. **Effort** – estimated time required (e.g. “45 minutes” or “1–2 days”).
3. **Tool/Link** – the tool, service or web link used; otherwise “–”.
4. **Expected impact** – one sentence describing the benefit.
5. **Start today?** – “Yes” or “No” to indicate whether it can begin immediately.

### 12‑Month Roadmap

Include 6–8 entries, each with the columns:

* **Month/Timing** – e.g. “Month 1,” “Q2,” or a specific date.
* **Task** – the core activity.
* **Owner/Role** – person or role driving the task; when unclear, use “Owner/Project Lead.”
* **Dependencies** – prerequisites or preceding steps (“none” if none).
* **Benefit/Outcome** – expected value or goal.

### Gamechanger Chapter

This chapter presents up to three innovative approaches. Besides “Moonshot,” “Benchmark,” “Forecast” and “Best Practice,” each block should include a **Trade‑off/Side‑Effect**. Describe in one sentence potential risks or side effects of the idea.

### Funding Logic

1. **State before federal** – Always include at least two state programmes (e.g. Berlin) and prioritise them over federal programmes.
2. **Synonyms & alias mapping** – Consider synonyms (Solo, start‑up, founding) and abbreviations (BE → Berlin) when searching.
3. **GründungsBONUS & Coaching BONUS** – When relevant for Berlin, ensure these programmes are included.

### AI Tools Table

Ensure the following columns are present: **Tool**, **Use case**, **Data location** (or Data protection) and **Cost** (or Cost category). Use a consistent cost scale (e.g. “< €100”, “€100–500”, “€500–1 000”, “> €1 000”). Add a footnote explaining the cost scale.

### Further notes

* Remove any leftover KPI lines from the Executive Summary.
* Maintain a serious, optimistic tone. Make recommendations precise, including clear owners and timeframes.
* Ensure tables and footnotes are not truncated and that page breaks are tidy.

### Gold+ Additions

* **KPI chips:** Create three KPI chips (2–5 words) summarizing measurable metrics or goals (e.g., “TTM −20%”, “Lead quality +15%”, “Error rate −30%”). Provide them as a `kpi_chips` list.
* **ROI tag:** Provide a ROI category for each recommendation (benefit/effort: High, Medium, Low).
* **Roadmap legend:** Use “Owner/Project lead” as the default assignee and “none” as default dependencies if unspecified.
* **Trade-off:** Add a one-sentence trade-off or side effect for each gamechanger block.
* **Not recommended:** Provide one or two anti‑patterns in `not_recommended_html` (an HTML list).
* **Next meeting:** Provide a `next_meeting_text` suggesting a follow-up meeting focusing on a key KPI.
