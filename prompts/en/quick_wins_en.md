Create **5 Quick Wins** tailored to {{BRIEFING_JSON}} (industry, main offering, company size, region).
**Output:** HTML fragment only. Use only `<div>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`.

Rules:
- **Owner** depends on size:
  - Size “solo” or “2–10”: Owner = “Me”; effort in **hours** (1–8h) → S/M/L.
  - Size “11–100”: Owner = **role/team**; effort 4–16h.
- Each action must be concrete, measurable, and aligned with the **main offering**.
- Avoid generic rituals; focus on automation, snippet libraries, compliance, delivery.

Structure per item:
<div class="qw">
  <p><strong>Action:</strong> [specific step] – <em>Why:</em> [clear benefit, e.g., time saved]</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Owner: [Me / Role]</li>
    <li>Effort: S/M/L (≈ hours)</li>
    <li>Tool/Tactic: [specific tool or approach]</li>
    <li>First steps: [3 short bullets]</li>
  </ul>
</div>
