Glossary & Further References

• Provide a brief explanation of each technical term either in parentheses within the text or as a numbered footnote.  If the term has already been explained earlier in the report, refer back to that explanation rather than repeating it.
• When additional information is relevant, point readers to helpful sources, such as funding programme links ({{ websearch_links_foerder }}) or tool recommendations ({{ websearch_links_tools }}).

You may plan internally how you will explain terms and cite sources, but do not output this planning.  The checklist itself is not part of the report.

Tip: Keep explanations concise and positive.  All recommendations and notes should be encouraging and easy for readers to act on.

After adding a new explanation or reference, check that it is clear, correctly placed and helpful.  Revise as necessary.

## Additional Instructions for the AI Status Report (EN)

Append these guidelines to the end of your existing prompt templates to elevate the AI Status Report to gold standard. They ensure concise lists, detailed actions and a clear, actionable roadmap.

### Trim and aggregate lists

* **Quick Wins (3 items)** – List no more than three immediately actionable wins. If there are more ideas, combine them into a single summary item titled “Additional Quick Wins.”
* **Risks (3 items)** – Mention at most three risks. Extra risks should be grouped under “Additional Risks,” summarised briefly.
* **Recommendations (5 items)** – Provide up to five recommendations. Any further suggestions are combined under “Additional Recommendations.”

### Structure of the Quick Wins

Each quick win should include the following fields:

1. **Title** – a concise name for the action.
2. **Effort** – estimated time required (e.g. “45 minutes” or “1–2 days”).
3. **Tool/Link** – the tool, service or web link used; otherwise “–”.
4. **Expected impact** – one sentence describing the benefit.
5. **Start today?** – “Yes” or “No” to indicate whether it can begin immediately.

### 12‑Month Roadmap

Include 6–8 entries, each with the columns:

* **Month/Timing** – e.g. “Month 1,” “Q2,” or a specific date.
* **Task** – the core activity.
* **Owner/Role** – person or role driving the task; when unclear, use “Owner/Project Lead.”
* **Dependencies** – prerequisites or preceding steps (“none” if none).
* **Benefit/Outcome** – expected value or goal.

### Gamechanger Chapter

This chapter presents up to three innovative approaches. Besides “Moonshot,” “Benchmark,” “Forecast” and “Best Practice,” each block should include a **Trade‑off/Side‑Effect**. Describe in one sentence potential risks or side effects of the idea.

### Funding Logic

1. **State before federal** – Always include at least two state programmes (e.g. Berlin) and prioritise them over federal programmes.
2. **Synonyms & alias mapping** – Consider synonyms (Solo, start‑up, founding) and abbreviations (BE → Berlin) when searching.
3. **GründungsBONUS & Coaching BONUS** – When relevant for Berlin, ensure these programmes are included.

### AI Tools Table

Ensure the following columns are present: **Tool**, **Use case**, **Data location** (or Data protection) and **Cost** (or Cost category). Use a consistent cost scale (e.g. “< €100”, “€100–500”, “€500–1 000”, “> €1 000”). Add a footnote explaining the cost scale.

### Further notes

* Remove any leftover KPI lines from the Executive Summary.
* Maintain a serious, optimistic tone. Make recommendations precise, including clear owners and timeframes.
* Ensure tables and footnotes are not truncated and that page breaks are tidy.
