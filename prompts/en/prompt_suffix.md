Glossary & Further References

• Provide a brief explanation of each technical term either in parentheses within the text or as a numbered footnote.  If the term has already been explained earlier in the report, refer back to that explanation rather than repeating it.
• When additional information is relevant, point readers to helpful sources, such as funding programme links ({{ websearch_links_foerder }}) or tool recommendations ({{ websearch_links_tools }}).

You may plan internally how you will explain terms and cite sources, but do not output this planning.  The checklist itself is not part of the report.

Tip: Keep explanations concise and positive.  All recommendations and notes should be encouraging and easy for readers to act on.

After adding a new explanation or reference, check that it is clear, correctly placed and helpful.  Revise as necessary.
