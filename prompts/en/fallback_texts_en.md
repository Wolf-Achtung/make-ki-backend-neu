## Safe First Steps
Begin with three small, low‑risk steps: First, consolidate customer data in an **EU‑hosted CRM**.
Second, adopt a **lightweight writing/research assistant** with an EU option for drafts and summaries —
always with human review. Third, automate **small routine tasks** like confirmations and file routing with logging.
Each step is reversible, data‑sparse and immediately helpful.

## Roadmap (no digits)
**Immediately:** Order data and approvals; short review checklist; traceable filing.
**In the coming weeks:** Two small automations with a pilot and logging.
**Within a year:** Two robust use cases with roles, deletion plan and a short quality guide.

## Compliance — What it means today
Human review before sending, light documentation (purpose, data, retention, deletion), logging.
Prefer EU hosting, practice data minimisation, keep decisions and rollback possible.
