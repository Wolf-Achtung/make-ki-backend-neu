## Quick, safe starters
Start with three proven steps that are low‑risk, low‑cost and data‑protection‑friendly. First, set up an EU‑hosted customer core so appointments, notes and quotes live in one place—exportable and lock‑in‑free. Second, let an EU‑hosted AI writing assistant propose drafts while you keep final approval. Third, automate calendar and e‑mail routines to consolidate requests and prepare replies. Fewer clicks, faster responses—fully GDPR‑conform.

## Risks
Reduce risk by enforcing purpose limitation and data minimisation, using a practical deletion policy and avoiding vendor lock‑in. Approve critical statements manually and feed models with current, clean sources. Clarify accountability for review, documentation and incident reporting.

## Roadmap
In the next 30 days, tidy up data and roles, pilot a small EU‑hosted use case and document approvals. By day 90, stabilise the pilot, add two routine automations and run a lightweight risk checklist. By day 365, professionalise training, versioning, export paths and annual review—with two productive AI use cases saving measurable time.

## Compliance
Embed GDPR, ePrivacy, DSA and the EU AI Act pragmatically: clear roles, data classification, processor agreements, deletion policy, transparency notices, human approval for AI outputs and export options against lock‑in.
