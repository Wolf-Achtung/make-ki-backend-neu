**Notes on preparing the report:**

- Each chapter in the report (Executive Summary, Tools, funding programmes, roadmap, compliance, best‑practice example, etc.) provides **unique, thematically distinct content** – **no tools, programmes or actions may be repeated across chapters**.
- Funding programmes, tools and web search results are available per chapter as variables (e.g., `{{ foerderprogramme_list }}`, `{{ tools_list }}`, `{{ websearch_links_foerder }}`) and **should only be inserted in the appropriate place**.
- Brief cross‑references ("see action plan", "see compliance chapter") are allowed, but **no content repetitions or lists**.

---

**Use of web search and context data:**

• **Web search links funding programmes:**  
  {{ websearch_links_foerder }}

• **Web search links tools:**  
  {{ websearch_links_tools }}

Analyse the key findings from these current search results and consider them only in the relevant chapters (e.g., tools only in the Tools chapter).

---

**Style & language:**

- Clear, precise, motivating and understandable for decision‑makers.
- Formulate recommendations as clear instructions for action (Why? Benefit? Next step!).
- **Avoid jargon:** explain important technical terms in brackets or as a footnote.
- Highlight opportunities and potential, emphasise practical feasibility.
- **Always output structured content as HTML** (tables, lists).

*The report is modular – each chapter delivers new added value without repetition!*
