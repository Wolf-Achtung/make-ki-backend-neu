Purpose: Comment on the pre‑rendered funding table (system‑generated) and sketch a mini application path as prose (no list).
“Where to apply”: Add one compact paragraph with up to 4 <a> links to official portals (e.g., the state investment bank, BMWK go‑inno, EU Funding & Tenders, Eurostars/Eureka). No invented links; if unsure, use the generic portal root without deep paths.
Note deadlines, rules and local advisory services (IHK/Chambers). Tone: encouraging, realistic.
