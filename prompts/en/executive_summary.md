# Executive Summary

Provide a clear and actionable executive summary tailored to the sector {{ branche }} and the main service {{ hauptleistung }}. Draw on the company’s free‑text responses and strategic objectives to deliver concise, practical guidance without marketing language.

* **KPI overview:** In one or two sentences, describe the company’s current performance in digitalisation, automation, paperless operations and AI know‑how, comparing each value to the industry benchmark. Explain whether the company is ahead, on par or behind its peers.
* **Opportunities:** Identify three sector‑specific opportunities grounded in the greatest potential ({{ groesstes_potenzial }}), preferred application area ({{ bereich_potenzial }}), moonshot vision ({{ moonshot }}) and strategic goals ({{ strategische_ziele }} / {{ goals }}). For each, explain why it is relevant and what tangible benefit it could deliver.
* **Risks:** Highlight two significant risks or obstacles (e.g., data privacy compliance, bias, vendor lock‑in) and briefly state the potential impact and why they matter for the company.
* **Next steps:** Suggest three concrete actions for the short to medium term. Each action should include a brief description, the expected benefit and a timeframe (for example, “finalise the questionnaire and release an MVP within 2 months”). Align each step with the company size ({{ unternehmensgroesse }}) and legal form ({{ unternehmensform }}) and consider the investment budget.

Every point must reflect the specific company context. Avoid generic statements and superfluous language. Do **not** include tools or funding programmes here; they are covered in separate chapters.
