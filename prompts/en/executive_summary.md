Write a **2–3 paragraph Executive Summary** for leadership.
Explain what is **feasible now**, why it matters (relief, quality, speed),
and where **caution** is appropriate (data, liability, EU AI Act).

Point to the report structure: **Safe First Steps**, a **staged roadmap**,
and **pragmatic compliance** as a working method (roles, approvals, documentation, deletion).
Stay concrete and everyday‑oriented, with **no percentages**.
