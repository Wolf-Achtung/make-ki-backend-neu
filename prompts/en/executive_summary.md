# Executive Summary

Provide a concise management summary tailored to the sector {{ branche }} (main service: {{ hauptleistung }}). Focus on the free‑text responses and strategic goals and formulate concrete, personalised recommendations:

* **AI readiness score:** {{ score_percent }} % (benchmark: {{ benchmark }})
* **Top opportunities:** Mention three sector‑specific opportunities arising from {{ hauptleistung }} and your strategic objectives, explicitly referencing free‑text answers (e.g., “greatest potential” or “moonshot”).  
* **Key risks:** Describe two main risks or obstacles (e.g., data privacy, bias, vendor lock‑in) and briefly explain why they are relevant.  
* **Next steps:** Provide three clear short‑ to medium‑term actions in the following structure:  
  1) **Develop an MVP portal:** Finalise the questionnaire and launch a minimal GPT‑powered analysis.  
  2) **Launch a pilot:** Secure 1–2 partners in the chosen focus area to test the offering.  
  3) **Secure funding:** Apply for a suitable funding programme (e.g., BAFA/go‑digital in {{ bundesland }}) by Q4 {{ datum[:4] }}.  
  Adjust each step to fit the company size ({{ unternehmensgroesse }}) and legal form ({{ unternehmensform }}), taking your investment budget into account.

Avoid generic statements – every point must reflect the specific company context. **Do not** detail tools or funding programmes here; these are covered in separate chapters.
