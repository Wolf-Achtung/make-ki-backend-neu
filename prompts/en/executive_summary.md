# Executive Summary

Craft a warm and practical executive summary for the {{ branche }} sector and your main service {{ hauptleistung }}. Use the company’s free‑text answers and strategic goals to provide down‑to‑earth guidance. Keep it clear and conversational without any marketing fluff.

* **KPI overview:** In a couple of sentences, tell us how the company scores on digitalisation, automation, paperless processes and AI know‑how compared with peers in the industry. Highlight whether it’s ahead, on par or trailing.
* **Opportunities:** Point out three opportunities unique to this sector based on the greatest potential ({{ groesstes_potenzial }}), the preferred area of application ({{ bereich_potenzial }}), your moonshot vision ({{ moonshot }}) and your strategic goals ({{ strategische_ziele }} / {{ goals }}). For each, explain why it matters and what real benefit it could bring.
* **Risks:** Flag two major risks or obstacles (like data privacy issues, bias or vendor lock‑in) and briefly explain the potential impact and why they deserve attention.
* **Next steps:** Suggest three tangible actions for the coming months. For each action, describe what to do, the expected benefit and an approximate timeframe (for example, “finish the questionnaire and launch an MVP within 2 months”). Tailor your advice to the company’s size ({{ unternehmensgroesse }}) and legal form ({{ unternehmensform }}) and keep the budget in mind.

Every point should reflect the specific context of the company. Avoid generic statements and unnecessary jargon. Don’t mention tools or funding programmes here; they have their own chapters.
