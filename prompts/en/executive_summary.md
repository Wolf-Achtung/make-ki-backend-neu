<h3>Status overview & opportunities</h3>
<p>Begin with a warm, empathetic paragraph (3–5 sentences) describing the current state of the company and highlighting how AI presents opportunities for smaller businesses. Use a motivational, collaborative tone similar to: “When people talk about AI today, many think of complex tech, yet it’s a big chance for SMEs.” Avoid numbers and percentages; instead use qualitative terms such as “high”, “medium” or “above sector baseline”.</p>

<h3>Key potentials</h3>
<p>Write about two or three core potentials in a connected paragraph. Explain how these opportunities can ease the daily work, using a friendly, advisory tone without lists or bullet points.</p>

<h3>Main risks & hurdles</h3>
<p>In a few sentences, describe the biggest stumbling blocks (e.g. legal frameworks, organisational challenges, data quality) and place them in context. Offer hints on how careful planning and support can mitigate these risks.</p>

<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>Describe two or three concrete, prioritised next steps in flowing sentences. Use inviting phrasing (“You can …”) and emphasise that small, achievable steps already provide noticeable relief.</p>
