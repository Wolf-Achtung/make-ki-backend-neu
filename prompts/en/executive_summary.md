# Executive Summary

Craft a warm, practical summary for decision makers in the {{ branche }} sector and for the main service {{ hauptleistung }}. Use free‑text responses, vision, strategic goals and context variables to make the report personal and relevant. Avoid marketing jargon; maintain a friendly, optimistic and encouraging tone.

The summary consists of four clearly structured sections (maximum three points each):

* **KPI overview:** Briefly explain how the company compares to peers in digitalisation, automation, paperless processes and AI know‑how (ahead, on par or behind). These terms are metrics only and must not appear in other sections.

* **Top opportunities:** List up to three sector‑specific opportunities emerging from {{ hauptleistung }} and the strategic goals. Draw on hints such as “biggest potential”, “application area”, “vision” and “moonshot”. If the vision or potential mentions GPT‑based services or a lightweight AI portal for SMEs, call this out explicitly as an opportunity. Describe the concrete benefit of each opportunity in one sentence.

* **Key risks:** List up to three major risks or obstacles (e.g. legal & compliance, data protection & data quality, budget/resource constraints or time pressure). Explain the potential impact and suggest a mitigation. Do not mention any of the KPI categories (digitalisation, automation, paperless processes, AI know‑how) as risks.

* **Next steps:** Recommend up to three concrete actions for the coming months. For each, describe what to do, the expected benefit and an approximate time frame. Adapt to company size {{ company_size_label }} and available budget: solo firms with limited time get lean, scalable actions; SMEs may pursue structural projects. Optionally refine using time capacity, existing tools, regulated industry status, training interests and vision priority—without naming these variables.

Optionally end with a short ROI estimate if both budget and time frame are available, phrased realistically and optimistically.

Avoid generic statements, repetition and jargon. Do not mention tools or funding programmes in this section; they belong elsewhere.
