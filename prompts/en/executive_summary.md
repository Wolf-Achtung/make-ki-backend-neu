Executive summary

Craft a warm and practical executive summary for the {{ branche }} sector and your main service {{ hauptleistung }}. Use the company’s free‑text answers and strategic goals to provide down‑to‑earth guidance. Keep it clear and conversational without any marketing fluff.

KPI overview: In a couple of sentences, tell us how the company scores on digitalisation, automation, paperless processes and AI know‑how compared with peers in the industry. Highlight whether it’s ahead, on par or trailing.

Top opportunities: Mention up to three sector‑specific opportunities that arise from {{ hauptleistung }} and the strategic goals. Draw on free‑text entries such as (if available) “biggest potential”, “application area”, “moonshot” and “strategic goals”. Explain the specific benefit for each opportunity.

Risks: Flag up to three major risks or obstacles (like data privacy issues, bias or vendor lock‑in) and briefly explain their potential impact and why they deserve attention.

Next steps: Suggest up to three tangible actions for the coming months. For each action, describe what to do, the expected benefit and an approximate timeframe (e.g. “finish the questionnaire and launch an MVP within 2 months”). Tailor your advice to the company’s size ({{ company_size_label }}) and legal form ({{ company_form }}) and keep the budget in mind.

Every point should reflect the specific context of the company. Avoid generic statements and unnecessary jargon. Don’t mention tools or funding programmes here; they have their own chapters.

Optional ROI estimate: If both budget and a time horizon (e.g. timeframe or zeitrahmen) are present in the context, add a single short paragraph at the end with a pragmatic ROI estimate (range, not exact), without introducing new placeholders.
