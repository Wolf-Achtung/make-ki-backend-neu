# Executive Summary
Provide a clear and actionable summary for executives in {{ branche }} (main service: {{ hauptleistung }}).
- **KPI overview:** In 1–2 sentences, classify each KPI (>=75 high, >=50 medium, else low) and reference the industry benchmark if available.
- **Key implications:** 3–5 bullets on what the numbers mean operationally.
- **Next 3 steps:** short, measurable actions (owner + timeframe where possible).
Rules: short sentences, no jargon, no repetition of the KPI list elsewhere.
