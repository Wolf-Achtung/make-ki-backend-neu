In three short paragraphs, describe where {{ company_size_label }} in {{ branche }} stands today, 
what {{ projektziel }} aims to achieve, and how AI can make a **felt** difference in day‑to‑day work.

Finish with qualitative signals we would notice after 6–12 weeks (“we feel…”, “our clients experience…”), without numbers.
