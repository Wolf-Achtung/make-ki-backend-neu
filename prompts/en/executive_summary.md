<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Write several connected paragraphs in a warm, empathetic tone that describe the organisation’s current state and highlight how AI presents opportunities for smaller businesses. Use qualitative terms such as “high”, “medium” or “above sector baseline” instead of numbers or percentages. Integrate a sector‑specific best‑practice story as a short narrative, showing how a similar organisation began its AI journey and what benefits it achieved. Avoid lists, bullet points and numeric references; the text should read like a friendly conversation.</p>

<p>Afterwards, address the key potentials, risks and next steps. Summarise the main opportunities in one paragraph and explain how they ease day‑to‑day work. Describe the biggest stumbling blocks (e.g. legal frameworks, organisational challenges, data quality) in another paragraph and explain how careful planning and support can mitigate these risks. Finish with a paragraph of invitingly phrased next steps – emphasise that small, achievable actions already provide tangible relief.</p>
