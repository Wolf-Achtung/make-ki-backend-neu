# Executive Summary

Craft a warm, practical summary for decision makers in the {{ branche }} sector and for the main service {{ hauptleistung }}. Use free‑text responses, vision, strategic goals and context variables to make the report personal and relevant. Avoid marketing jargon; maintain a friendly, optimistic and encouraging tone.

The summary consists of four clearly structured sections (maximum three points each):

* **KPI overview:** Briefly explain how the company compares to peers in digitalisation, automation, paperless processes and AI know‑how (ahead, on par or behind). These terms are metrics only and must not appear in other sections.

* **Top opportunities:** List up to three sector‑specific opportunities emerging from {{ hauptleistung }} and the strategic goals. Draw on hints such as “biggest potential”, “application area”, “vision” and “moonshot”. If the vision or potential mentions GPT‑based services or a lightweight AI portal for SMEs, call this out explicitly as an opportunity. Describe the concrete benefit of each opportunity in one sentence.

* **Key risks:** List up to three major risks or obstacles (e.g. legal & compliance, data protection & data quality, budget/resource constraints or time pressure). Explain the potential impact and suggest a mitigation. Do not mention any of the KPI categories (digitalisation, automation, paperless processes, AI know‑how) as risks.

* **Next steps:** Recommend up to three concrete actions for the coming months. For each, describe what to do, the expected benefit and an approximate time frame. Adapt to company size {{ company_size_label }} and available budget: solo firms with limited time get lean, scalable actions; SMEs may pursue structural projects. Optionally refine using time capacity, existing tools, regulated industry status, training interests and vision priority—without naming these variables.

Optionally end with a short ROI estimate if both budget and time frame are available, phrased realistically and optimistically.

Avoid generic statements, repetition and jargon. Do not mention tools or funding programmes in this section; they belong elsewhere.

## Additional Instructions for the AI Status Report (EN)

Append these guidelines to the end of your existing prompt templates to elevate the AI Status Report to gold standard. They ensure concise lists, detailed actions and a clear, actionable roadmap.

### Trim and aggregate lists

* **Quick Wins (3 items)** – List no more than three immediately actionable wins. If there are more ideas, combine them into a single summary item titled “Additional Quick Wins.”
* **Risks (3 items)** – Mention at most three risks. Extra risks should be grouped under “Additional Risks,” summarised briefly.
* **Recommendations (5 items)** – Provide up to five recommendations. Any further suggestions are combined under “Additional Recommendations.”

### Structure of the Quick Wins

Each quick win should include the following fields:

1. **Title** – a concise name for the action.
2. **Effort** – estimated time required (e.g. “45 minutes” or “1–2 days”).
3. **Tool/Link** – the tool, service or web link used; otherwise “–”.
4. **Expected impact** – one sentence describing the benefit.
5. **Start today?** – “Yes” or “No” to indicate whether it can begin immediately.

### 12‑Month Roadmap

Include 6–8 entries, each with the columns:

* **Month/Timing** – e.g. “Month 1,” “Q2,” or a specific date.
* **Task** – the core activity.
* **Owner/Role** – person or role driving the task; when unclear, use “Owner/Project Lead.”
* **Dependencies** – prerequisites or preceding steps (“none” if none).
* **Benefit/Outcome** – expected value or goal.

### Gamechanger Chapter

This chapter presents up to three innovative approaches. Besides “Moonshot,” “Benchmark,” “Forecast” and “Best Practice,” each block should include a **Trade‑off/Side‑Effect**. Describe in one sentence potential risks or side effects of the idea.

### Funding Logic

1. **State before federal** – Always include at least two state programmes (e.g. Berlin) and prioritise them over federal programmes.
2. **Synonyms & alias mapping** – Consider synonyms (Solo, start‑up, founding) and abbreviations (BE → Berlin) when searching.
3. **GründungsBONUS & Coaching BONUS** – When relevant for Berlin, ensure these programmes are included.

### AI Tools Table

Ensure the following columns are present: **Tool**, **Use case**, **Data location** (or Data protection) and **Cost** (or Cost category). Use a consistent cost scale (e.g. “< €100”, “€100–500”, “€500–1 000”, “> €1 000”). Add a footnote explaining the cost scale.

### Further notes

* Remove any leftover KPI lines from the Executive Summary.
* Maintain a serious, optimistic tone. Make recommendations precise, including clear owners and timeframes.
* Ensure tables and footnotes are not truncated and that page breaks are tidy.
