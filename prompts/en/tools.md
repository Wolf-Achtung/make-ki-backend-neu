Purpose: Comment on the pre‑rendered tools table (system‑generated). Then write 2–3 paragraphs:
1) Which of the two preferred stacks fits best (see mapping) and why.
2) How to integrate those tools into today’s landscape (existing_tools, it_infrastruktur, datenquellen, data_quality).
3) Short caveats: verify EU region/DPA, keep a human‑in‑the‑loop, ensure export & rollback.
Do not generate new tables; the table is already present.
# Hard branch‑stacks (weighting for selection & commentary)
# Use this mapping to interpret the tools table and spotlight two preferred stacks.
# Categories: crm, writing, automation, project, security (same as the table).
