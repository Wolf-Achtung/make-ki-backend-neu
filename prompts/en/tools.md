Purpose
Recommend a practical tool stack for {{branche}} and {{company_size_label}}, prioritising EU‑hosted or privacy‑robust options that slot neatly into existing flows (CRM, DMS, email, CMS).

Content
Explain, in paragraphs:
– A compact set across authoring/assistant, knowledge search, automation/workflows, and data/doc work, with concrete everyday benefits.
– Integration paths (e.g., email → ticket → draft reply; DMS → vector search → knowledge notes).
– Safe Starter Steps (new name for “No‑Regrets”): data‑lean pilots, roles & rights, prompt guardrails, human review, logging.
– Short risks & mitigations (hallucinations → editorial loop; lock‑in → export; transfers → EU options).

Form
2–3 paragraphs, no lists/tables/numbers. Name 2–4 realistic tools only if suitable and GDPR‑friendly; otherwise use categories with EU‑option notes.
