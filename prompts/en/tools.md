Current AI tools & software for {{ branche }} (status as of {{ datum }})

Create a structured overview of the most relevant AI tools for {{ branche }} with a focus on your main service {{ hauptleistung }}. Take into account your company size ({{ unternehmensgroesse }}) and investment budget ({{ investitionsbudget }}).

1. Selection criteria:

• Relevance for typical use cases such as {{ hauptleistung }} and {{ projektziel }}, and a high degree of innovation  
• Compatibility with your IT infrastructure ({{ it_infrastruktur }}) and suitability for the target group {{ zielgruppen }}  
• Preference for GDPR/EU‑compliant providers; only tools available in EU/DE markets

2. Sector context:

• Use the sector‑specific tool list as a starting point:  
  {{ tools_list }}  
• Add at most 1–2 current tools from web‑search results if they provide genuine added value:  
  {{ websearch_links_tools }}

3. Presentation:

• Present the tools in an HTML table with the columns **Name**, **Use case**, **Cost** and **Link**.  
• For **Cost**, give a rough indication (e.g., “from €29/month” or “free”); omit provider names and data‑privacy comments.  
• List no more than 5–7 tools that are particularly suitable for {{ branche }} and {{ hauptleistung }}.

*Do not include generic introductions or practical tips – these belong in the action plan.*
