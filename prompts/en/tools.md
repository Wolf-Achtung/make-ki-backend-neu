# Current AI tools & software for {{ branche }} (status as of {{ datum }})

Create a structured overview of the most relevant AI tools for {{ branche }}:

**1. Selection criteria:**  
- Practical relevance, degree of innovation, data protection (DE/EU)
- Compatibility with your IT infrastructure ({{ it_infrastruktur }}) and company size ({{ unternehmensgroesse }})
- Reference to typical use cases (e.g., {{ hauptleistung }}, {{ projektziel }}, {{ zielgruppen }})

**2. Industry context:**  
- Use this industry‑specific tool list as inspiration:  
  {{ tools_list }}
- Additionally integrate the following up‑to‑date web search links (only if they contain new/relevant tools):  
  {{ websearch_links_tools }}

**3. Presentation:**  
– Use an HTML table with four columns: **Name**, **Use case**, **Cost**, and **Link**.
– For **Cost**, provide an approximate range (e.g., “from €29/month”, “free”); there is no need to include provider or privacy columns.
– List at most 5–7 tools and choose only solutions that are particularly relevant to {{ branche }} and your main service {{ hauptleistung }}. Avoid duplicate mentions from other chapters.
– Do not include any generic best‑practice tips or introductory advice – these belong in the roadmap.

**Tip:**  
– Output the table directly as HTML (without ``` code fences). Keep column headers short to avoid line breaks.
