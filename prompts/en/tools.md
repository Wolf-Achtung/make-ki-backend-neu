Recommend a **brand‑light tool path** with EU options, fully in prose:
- **CRM/contact hub** as the data backbone (export, roles, logs).
- **Writing/research assistant** with EU data region and a data‑sparse mode, always with human review.
- **Small automation layer** for standard tasks (confirmations, file routing, templates).

Describe **selection criteria** (EU hosting/region, export, roles/logs, reversibility) and **benefit/side effect** per block.
Mention brands sparingly and **avoid percentages**; principles and decision‑readiness matter more.
