# Best practice example

{{ best_practice }}

• Choose a recent, relevant case from the **{{ branche }}** sector with a comparable company size and main service (**{{ hauptleistung }}**) using the industry context file.  
If no suitable real-world case is available, craft a brief fictional scenario (2–3 sentences) based on the free-text responses. Tailor this example to the company size: solo, small team or SME.
• Describe in 2–3 sentences how the project was carried out and what tangible results it achieved (e.g., **35–40 % less time per project**, **20–25 % higher customer satisfaction**, **15–20 % revenue growth**). Use ranges to convey approximate impact.  
• Briefly state what lessons other companies can draw from this example and how it aligns with your own strategic vision. Avoid lists and do not mention tools or funding programmes.
