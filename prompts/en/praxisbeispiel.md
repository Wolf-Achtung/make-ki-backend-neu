## Best practice example

{{ best_practice }}

You may internally plan the steps to select and describe an appropriate example (2–3 lines), but do not output this checklist.

- Choose one current, relevant case from the {{ branche }} sector with comparable company size and main service ({{ hauptleistung }}) (see the industry context file). If no suitable real‑world example is available, create a short, fictional scenario (2–3 sentences) based on the free‑text responses. Adapt it to the company size: solo, small team or SME.
- In 2–3 sentences, describe how the project was implemented and what specific results were achieved (e.g. **40 % less time required**, **30 % higher customer satisfaction** or **20 % revenue growth**). Avoid lists and do not mention further tools or programmes.
- Briefly indicate what lessons similar companies can learn and how the example contributes to their vision.

After writing the description, validate in 1–2 sentences that the scenario is clear, relevant and meets the specifications. Only proceed if validation passes; otherwise, make targeted adjustments.
