Purpose
Tell a short, credible case story from {{branche}} that fits {{company_size_label}} and {{hauptleistung}}. Show the shift from “before” to “after” through felt effects (quality, time, consistency) rather than numbers.

Content
Describe the starting pain, the approach (process + one or two named, EU‑friendly tools), and the tangible day‑to‑day outcome.
Add a brief change‑management moment (training, acceptance, roles). Anchor compliance (Privacy by Design, access control, logging).

Form
Two to three paragraphs, no lists/tables/percentages. Shape it as a mini‑story: situation → turning point → new normal.
