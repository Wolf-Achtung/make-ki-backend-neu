• Describe in 2–3 sentences how the project was carried out and what tangible results it achieved (e.g., **35–40 % less time per project**, **20–25 % higher customer satisfaction**, **15–20 % revenue growth**). Use ranges to convey approximate impact.  
• Briefly state what lessons other companies can draw from this example and how it aligns with your own strategic vision. Avoid lists and do not mention tools or funding programmes.
