## Best practice example

{{ best_practice }}

You may internally plan the steps to select and describe an appropriate example (2–3 lines), but do not output this checklist.

- Choose one current, relevant case from the {{ branche }} sector with comparable company size and main service ({{ hauptleistung }}) (see the industry context file). If no suitable real‑world example is available, create a short, fictional scenario (2–3 sentences) based on the free‑text responses. Adapt it to the company size: solo, small team or SME.
- In 2–3 sentences, describe how the project was implemented and what specific results were achieved (e.g. **40 % less time required**, **30 % higher customer satisfaction** or **20 % revenue growth**). Avoid lists and do not mention further tools or programmes.
- Briefly indicate what lessons similar companies can learn and how the example contributes to their vision.

After writing the description, validate in 1–2 sentences that the scenario is clear, relevant and meets the specifications. Only proceed if validation passes; otherwise, make targeted adjustments.

## Additional Instructions for the AI Status Report (EN)

Append these guidelines to the end of your existing prompt templates to elevate the AI Status Report to gold standard. They ensure concise lists, detailed actions and a clear, actionable roadmap.

### Trim and aggregate lists

* **Quick Wins (3 items)** – List no more than three immediately actionable wins. If there are more ideas, combine them into a single summary item titled “Additional Quick Wins.”
* **Risks (3 items)** – Mention at most three risks. Extra risks should be grouped under “Additional Risks,” summarised briefly.
* **Recommendations (5 items)** – Provide up to five recommendations. Any further suggestions are combined under “Additional Recommendations.”

### Structure of the Quick Wins

Each quick win should include the following fields:

1. **Title** – a concise name for the action.
2. **Effort** – estimated time required (e.g. “45 minutes” or “1–2 days”).
3. **Tool/Link** – the tool, service or web link used; otherwise “–”.
4. **Expected impact** – one sentence describing the benefit.
5. **Start today?** – “Yes” or “No” to indicate whether it can begin immediately.

### 12‑Month Roadmap

Include 6–8 entries, each with the columns:

* **Month/Timing** – e.g. “Month 1,” “Q2,” or a specific date.
* **Task** – the core activity.
* **Owner/Role** – person or role driving the task; when unclear, use “Owner/Project Lead.”
* **Dependencies** – prerequisites or preceding steps (“none” if none).
* **Benefit/Outcome** – expected value or goal.

### Gamechanger Chapter

This chapter presents up to three innovative approaches. Besides “Moonshot,” “Benchmark,” “Forecast” and “Best Practice,” each block should include a **Trade‑off/Side‑Effect**. Describe in one sentence potential risks or side effects of the idea.

### Funding Logic

1. **State before federal** – Always include at least two state programmes (e.g. Berlin) and prioritise them over federal programmes.
2. **Synonyms & alias mapping** – Consider synonyms (Solo, start‑up, founding) and abbreviations (BE → Berlin) when searching.
3. **GründungsBONUS & Coaching BONUS** – When relevant for Berlin, ensure these programmes are included.

### AI Tools Table

Ensure the following columns are present: **Tool**, **Use case**, **Data location** (or Data protection) and **Cost** (or Cost category). Use a consistent cost scale (e.g. “< €100”, “€100–500”, “€500–1 000”, “> €1 000”). Add a footnote explaining the cost scale.

### Further notes

* Remove any leftover KPI lines from the Executive Summary.
* Maintain a serious, optimistic tone. Make recommendations precise, including clear owners and timeframes.
* Ensure tables and footnotes are not truncated and that page breaks are tidy.
