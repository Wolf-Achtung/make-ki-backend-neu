Purpose: Write a warm, precise executive narrative as clean HTML paragraphs (no lists). Use <h3 class='sub'> for up to two subheads.
Profile anchors: Strictly use profile.main product/service (hauptleistung), company size (unternehmensgroesse), region/state (bundesland/standort) and, where present, data quality (datenqualitaet/data_quality), data sources (datenquellen), existing tools (existing_tools/vorhandene_tools) and IT setup (it_infrastruktur).

Delivery:
- 2–4 paragraphs that state benefits, pragmatic next steps, and risks/mitigations.
- Emphasise EU hosting; human approval, logs and export as trust anchors.
- One sentence that names the two preferred tool‑stacks for the branch (see mapping) without bullets.

Rules:
- Polite “per Sie” tone equivalent, optimistic, no marketing‑speak. No percentages. No tables.
- Briefly place GDPR, ePrivacy, DSA and the EU AI Act in plain language.
- No hype; prefer small, certain gains (“immediately”, “in the coming weeks”, “within a year”).

Branch weighting (for guidance, do not print):
# Hard branch‑stacks (weighting for selection & commentary)
# Use this mapping to interpret the tools table and spotlight two preferred stacks.
# Categories: crm, writing, automation, project, security (same as the table).
