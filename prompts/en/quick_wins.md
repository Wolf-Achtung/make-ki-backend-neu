# Quick wins – immediate actions

Create an HTML unordered list (`<ul>…</ul>`) containing three to five quick wins that the company can implement within the next 0–3 months. Each bullet should start with a bold keyword (`<b>…</b>`) followed by a single sentence that describes the action and its expected benefit. Use the company’s free‑text responses (vision, moonshot, greatest potential, use case, strategic goals) and industry context to propose tailored, practical suggestions. Avoid vague phrases or duplication.

Example:

```
<ul>
  <li><b>MVP portal:</b> Finalise the questionnaire and launch a lean MVP portal with GPT analysis to collect early feedback.</li>
  <li><b>Pilot partners:</b> Recruit 1–2 partners in the priority use case and measure success metrics such as time saved and client satisfaction.</li>
  …
</ul>
```
