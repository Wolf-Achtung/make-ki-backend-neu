# Quick wins – immediate actions

Create an HTML unordered list (`<ul>…</ul>`) with three to five quick wins for the company. Each bullet should be a single sentence describing an action that can be implemented within the next 0–3 months and delivers high impact with low effort. Leverage the free‑text answers (vision, moonshot, greatest potential, use case, strategic goals) and industry context to provide tailored, practical suggestions. Bold the first keyword of each point (`<b>…</b>`). Avoid generic phrases or duplication.

Example:

```
<ul>
  <li><b>MVP portal:</b> Finalise the questionnaire and launch a lean MVP portal with GPT analysis.</li>
  <li><b>Pilot:</b> Recruit 1–2 partners in the priority use case and measure success metrics.</li>
  …
</ul>
```
