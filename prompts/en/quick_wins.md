**Purpose**
Present the **Safe First Steps** as short, connected prose (2–3 paragraphs, **no lists**).
Describe three **small, reversible actions** that respect privacy and deliver immediate relief.

**Content guardrails**
- An **EU‑hosted CRM / contact hub** as the central place for customer threads (exportable).
- A **lightweight writing/research assistant** with EU option, always with human review.
- **Small automations** for routine tasks (confirmations, file routing) with logging and rollback.

**Output**
Warm paragraphs; for each step mention **benefit and a small caveat** (one sentence).
