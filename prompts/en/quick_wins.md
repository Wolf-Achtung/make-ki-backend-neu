# Quick Wins – immediate actions

Generate an HTML unordered list (`<ul>…</ul>`) with up to three quick wins. Each line should begin with a bold keyword (`<b>…</b>`) and describe a specific measure that can realistically be implemented within the next 0–3 months. Keep each line to one sentence and clearly state the benefit.

Use the free‑text fields (vision, biggest potential, moonshot, application area, strategic goals) and industry context to tailor suggestions. Optionally consider weekly time capacity, existing tools, regulated industry status, training interests and vision priority to align quick wins with resources, compliance and learning needs—without naming those variables. The lower the time capacity (e.g. ≤ 5 hours per week) the smaller and quicker the quick win should be; with more time available (e.g. 5–15 hours) the actions may be slightly more involved.

Guidelines:

- **Data inventory:** If data quality is low or unclear, a structured data inventory or data clean‑up should be the first quick win.
 - **Automation & scripts:** When there is interest in automation or a lack of time, a small automation – for example using general no‑code tools – can be a quick win.  Do not name specific products (like Zapier or n8n); describe the solution in general terms.
- **Governance light:** For solo businesses or small teams, drafting a one‑page AI policy can be a meaningful quick win.
- **Pilot & feedback:** If the greatest potential includes GPT‑based services or an AI portal, a lean MVP pilot with initial customers or partners can be a valuable quick win.
- Choose up to three quick wins; avoid repeating items from the recommendations or the action plan.

If insufficient context is available, list the few quick wins that are possible. If no meaningful suggestions can be derived, output the following list: `<ul><li>No quick wins available. Additional information is needed for specific suggestions.</li></ul>`.

Return only an HTML block containing the unordered list with 1–3 `<li>` elements, or the above error message.
