# Quick wins – immediate actions

Create an HTML unordered list (`<ul>…</ul>`) containing **no more than three quick wins** that the company can implement within the next 0–3 months. Each bullet should start with a bold keyword (`<b>…</b>`) and consist of a single sentence that describes the action and its expected benefit. Use the company’s free‑text responses (vision, moonshot, greatest potential, application area, strategic goals) and industry context to propose **tailored, practical suggestions**. Keep the tone friendly and positive. Avoid vague phrases or repetition, and choose quick wins that suit solo professionals, small teams (2–10) or SMEs (11–100) without explicitly naming these categories in the report.

Consider the weekly time capacity (`time_capacity`), any existing tools (`existing_tools`), regulated industry flags (`regulated_industry`), training interests (`training_interests`) and the prioritised vision element (`vision_priority`) to fine‑tune your quick wins to the company's resources, compliance framework, learning needs and strategic focus. Do not explicitly mention these variable names in the text.

Example:

```
<ul>
  <li><b>MVP portal:</b> Finalise the questionnaire and publish a lean MVP portal with AI analysis to gather early feedback.</li>
  <li><b>Pilot partners:</b> Recruit 1–2 partners in the priority use case and measure success using concrete metrics such as hours saved.</li>
  <li><b>Data inventory:</b> Create a structured inventory of all relevant data sources to build a solid foundation for future AI projects.</li>
</ul>
```
