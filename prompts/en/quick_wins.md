# Quick wins – immediate actions

Create an HTML unordered list (`<ul>…</ul>`) containing three to five quick wins that the company can implement within the next 0–3 months. Each bullet should start with a bold keyword (`<b>…</b>`) followed by a single sentence that describes the action and its expected benefit. Use the company’s free‑text responses (vision, moonshot, greatest potential, use case, strategic goals) and industry context to propose tailored, practical suggestions. Avoid vague phrases or duplication.


Take company size into account: For <b>solo professionals</b>, focus on quick, low-cost wins such as mini subscription products, automated invoicing and scheduling, or a data‑privacy starter kit (e.g. DPA templates).
For <b>small teams (2–10 people)</b>, quick wins should include building a shared prompt library, creating a roles matrix with clear approval workflows and setting up a central knowledge hub (e.g. Notion).
For <b>SMEs (11–100)</b>, emphasise process digitisation, establishing governance structures (e.g. RoPA, audit trails) and selecting scalable tools.

Example:

```
<ul>
  <li><b>MVP portal:</b> Finalise the questionnaire and launch a lean MVP portal with GPT analysis to collect early feedback.</li>
  <li><b>Pilot partners:</b> Recruit 1–2 partners in the priority use case and measure success metrics such as time saved and client satisfaction.</li>
  …
</ul>
