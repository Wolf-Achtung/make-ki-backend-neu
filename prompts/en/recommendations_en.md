<!-- RECOMMENDATIONS (EN)
Context:
BRIEFING_JSON  = {{BRIEFING_JSON}}
SCORING_JSON   = {{SCORING_JSON}}
TOOLS_JSON     = {{TOOLS_JSON}}
BUSINESS_JSON  = {{BUSINESS_JSON}}

Goal:
Provide 3–5 prioritized recommendations. Each with a short title, first step (0–14 days),
KPI(s), dependencies and a payback target. Do not invent numbers; use BUSINESS_JSON as context only
and phrase payback as "≤ 4 months" if plausible.

Ordering:
1) high KPI leverage (Δ vs. benchmark), 2) low integration effort (tools), 3) alignment with core service.
