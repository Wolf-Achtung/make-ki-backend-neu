<p>Propose a long‑term initiative that could transform the organisation, taking into account its sector ({{ branche }}).

Integrate a vivid example or metaphor (e.g. a “digital garden”) to make the benefits tangible. Avoid numbers, buzzwords and lists, and mention any potential side effects or risks carefully within the narrative.</p>
