<p>Write one or two connected paragraphs describing immediately actionable quick wins. Use a warm, encouraging tone and avoid lists, bullet points or numbers. Instead of bullet‑style instructions, tell a short story showing how a company found relief by taking small steps – for example scheduling a data inventory session, creating a simple checklist or piloting a new tool. Encourage the reader that minimal changes can ease the workload. Avoid mentioning brand names or commercial products and keep the style flowing.</p>
