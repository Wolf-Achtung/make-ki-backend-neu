  <h2>Legal Pitfalls When Using AI in Companies</h2>
  <p>AI promises efficiency and speed — without a plan you risk friction, legal exposure and rework. These ten pitfalls
     and countermeasures are adapted from the German checklist and aligned with the EU AI Act timeline (full compliance
     by August 2027, parts earlier).</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Ignoring regulation too long.</strong> Plan for EU AI Act obligations early; retrofitting is costly.</li>
    <li><strong>No inventory.</strong> Keep a mandatory AI registry with roles, risk class, duties and evidence.</li>
    <li><strong>No lifecycle guardrails.</strong> Standardise selection, testing, approvals, documentation and monitoring.</li>
    <li><strong>Trusting laws, forgetting contracts.</strong> Put information duties, security, audit, changes and IP into contracts.</li>
    <li><strong>Overlooking IP.</strong> Clarify chain of rights for models, training/input data and outputs; do input/output checks.</li>
    <li><strong>Under/overestimating AI literacy.</strong> Provide role‑based training and refreshers.</li>
    <li><strong>No change control and agents.</strong> Define re‑classification triggers (fine‑tuning, purpose/brand change, agents), enforce HiTL and kill‑switch.</li>
    <li><strong>AI Act tunnel vision.</strong> Consider product law, CRA, DSA, Data Act and sector rules.</li>
    <li><strong>Ignoring tech change.</strong> Establish a tech radar and periodic reviews (performance/drift/bias).</li>
    <li><strong>Starting without a plan.</strong> Put the topic on the agenda before first use cases go live.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Immediate To‑Dos</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Apply the AI Act to your business model; implement a go‑live gate and a minimal viable compliance set.</li>
    <li>Set up and use the AI registry across the company.</li>
    <li>Roll out lifecycle controls and assign responsibilities.</li>
    <li>Standardise contracts and clarify rights for inputs and outputs.</li>
    <li>Launch AI literacy with documented refreshers; link access rights to training status.</li>
    <li>Plan re‑classification triggers, HiTL and a working kill‑switch.</li>
  </ul>
