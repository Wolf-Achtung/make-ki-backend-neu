  <h2>Legal Pitfalls When Using AI in Companies</h2>
  <p>AI promises efficiency and speed — without a plan you risk friction, legal exposure and rework. These ten pitfalls and countermeasures are aligned with the EU AI Act timeline.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Ignoring regulation too long.</strong> Plan for EU AI Act obligations early; retrofitting is costly.</li>
    <li><strong>No inventory.</strong> Keep a mandatory AI registry with roles, risk class, duties and evidence.</li>
    <li><strong>No lifecycle guardrails.</strong> Standardise selection, testing, approvals, documentation and monitoring.</li>
    <li><strong>Trusting laws, forgetting contracts.</strong> Put information duties, security, audit, changes and IP into contracts.</li>
    <li><strong>Overlooking IP.</strong> Clarify chain of rights for models, training/input data and outputs; do input/output checks.</li>
    <li><strong>Under/overestimating AI literacy.</strong> Provide role‑based training and refreshers.</li>
    <li><strong>No change control/agents.</strong> Define re‑classification triggers, enforce HiTL and kill‑switch.</li>
    <li><strong>AI Act tunnel vision.</strong> Consider product law, CRA, DSA, Data Act and sector rules.</li>
    <li><strong>Ignoring tech change.</strong> Establish a tech radar and periodic reviews (performance/drift/bias).</li>
    <li><strong>Starting without a plan.</strong> Put the topic on the agenda before first use cases go live.</li>
  </ol>
